# Keystone — Purpose

Keystone is a self-hosted deployment control panel for a single VPS that enables reliable, repeatable deployment of multiple applications from GitHub using Docker and Traefik.

Its purpose is to eliminate deployment chaos caused by manual SSH workflows, port conflicts, ad-hoc Nginx configurations, and undocumented tribal knowledge.

Keystone provides a standardized deployment layer so that applications can be added, deployed, updated, monitored, and rolled back in a predictable way.

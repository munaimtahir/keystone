# Executive Summary

Keystone is a VPS deployment operating system.

It installs once and becomes the single authoritative interface through which all applications are deployed and managed on a server.

By centralizing routing (Traefik), runtime (Docker), and deployment workflows, Keystone allows multiple applications to coexist on a single VPS without conflicts.

The system is designed for small teams and solo operators who need professional-grade deployment discipline without full DevOps overhead.
